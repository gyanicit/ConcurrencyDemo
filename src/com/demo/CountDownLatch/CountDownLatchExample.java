/*
 * CountDownLatch is used to make sure that a task waits for other threads before it starts.
 * To understand its application, let us consider a server where the main task can only start when all the required services have started.
 * 
 * Working of CountDownLatch:
 * -----------------------------
 * When we create an object of CountDownLatch, we specify the number of threads it should wait for,
 * all such thread are required to do count down by calling CountDownLatch.countDown() once they are
 * completed or ready to the job. As soon as count reaches zero, the waiting task starts running.
